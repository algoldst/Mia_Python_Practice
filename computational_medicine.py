def identify_genetic_palindrome():
    """
    In genetics, palindromic sequences are common in DNA, where they often
    form part of recognition sites for restriction enzymes or play important 
    roles in the regulation of genes. 
    
    A palindromic sequence is one that reads the same forwards and backwards 
    (e.g., 'GAATTC' is a palindrome because its reverse complement is also 'GAATTC').
    
    Your mission: Write a function that takes in a DNA sequence and checks 
    whether it is a palindrome. 
        - The function should account for the complementary base pairs in DNA
          (A pairs with T, and C pairs with G). 
        - The function should return whether the given sequence is a valid DNA 
          palindrome, meaning that its reverse complement matches the sequence 
          itself.

    Write a function that takes in a list of vaccinations a patient has

    Write a function that takes in a dictionary of medical treatments and their associated

    only those treatments whose cost is above a certain threshold.

    Write a function that takes in a string of clinical data (such as a list
    of patient-reported symptoms) and returns a dictionary where the keys are
    symptoms, and the values are the number of times each symptom appears across
    the dataset. This can be used to track the prevalence of different symptoms 
    in a cohort of patients.

    Example:
        count_symptom_frequencies("fever, headache, cough, fever, fatigue")

        {"fever": 2, "headache": 1, "cough": 1, "fatigue": 1}
