# Intro file input/output (I/O) exercises
# Fill in the code for the functions below. main() is already set up
# to call the functions with a few different inputs,
# printing 'OK' when each function is correct.
# The starter code for each function includes a 'return'
# which is just a placeholder for your code.
# Try to complete as many functions as you can! ‚ù§
# Keep an eye out for surprises in the output when you 
# get all tests in a function correct!
