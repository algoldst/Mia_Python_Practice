# Intro dictionary (dict) exercises
# Fill in the code for the functions below. main() is already set up
# to call the functions with a few different inputs,
# printing 'OK' when each function is correct.
# The starter code for each function includes a 'return'
# which is just a placeholder for your code.
# Try to complete as many functions as you can! ❤
# Keep an eye out for surprises in the output when you 
# get all tests in a function correct!

def identify_high_cost_treatments(treatments: dict, threshold: float) -> dict:
    """
    Write a function that takes in a dictionary of medical treatments and their associated
    costs (e.g., 'gene therapy': 50000, 'chemotherapy': 2000) and returns a dictionary with
    only those treatments whose cost is above a certain threshold. 
    
    This information will be used in our lab to focus our research toward high-cost treatments
    that need lower-cost, affordable alternatives developed.

def count_symptom_frequency(symptom: str, report: str) -> dict:
    """
    Write a function that takes in a string of clinical data (such as a list
    of patient-reported symptoms) and returns a dictionary where the keys are
    symptoms, and the values are the number of times each symptom appears across
    the dataset. This can be used to track the prevalence of different symptoms 
    in a cohort of patients.

    Example:
        count_symptom_frequencies("fever, headache, cough, fever, fatigue")
    Output: 
        {"fever": 2, "headache": 1, "cough": 1, "fatigue": 1}
