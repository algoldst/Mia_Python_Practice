Hi Mia! 

These modules should help you as you are getting started with your first programming language. Each one is a medically-themed clinical / research scenario for you to solve. 

Here's the order to do them:

1. strings.py
2. lists.py
3. dicts.py
4. diagnosis.py

  
The last one is a full project to show what cool possibilities are within your reach with just a little bit of programming experience!

If you need any help, ask your boyfriend (that's me!) for some guaranteed non-judgemental, stress-free 1:1 assistance. 

You've got this! ❤️
